# Time-Warp-Unravelling-Time-Series-with-R

This repository contains implementations and examples of various time series analysis techniques using R. From basic visualization to advanced models like Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Exponential Smoothing, Moving Average, and more, this repository serves as a comprehensive resource for understanding and working with time series data in R.

## Techniques Covered

- **AIC-BIC:** Understand the concepts of Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) for model selection in time series analysis.
- **Auto-Regressive (AR) Models:** Learn about Auto-Regressive models and their application in time series forecasting.
- **ARIMA (Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average):** Dive into the popular ARIMA model for time series forecasting, encompassing auto-regression, differencing, and moving average components.
- **Exponential Smoothing:** Explore exponential smoothing methods for capturing trends and seasonal patterns in time series data.
- **Moving Average:** Understand the moving average model and its utility in smoothing out noise and identifying trends.
- **Spectral Density Analysis:** Analyze the frequency domain characteristics of time series data using spectral density estimation techniques.
- **STL (Seasonal and Trend decomposition using Loess) Model:** Decompose time series into seasonal, trend, and residual components using the STL decomposition method.
- **Time Series Visualization:** Visualize time series data using various plotting techniques to gain insights into trends, seasonality, and patterns.

## Contents
